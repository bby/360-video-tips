# There is no behind the camera

* If you don’t want to be in the scene you'll need to hide and remotely control the camera
* What if the people around us don’t want to be seen on camera?

# No need to pan or tilt

* Since the 360-degree camera shoots everything in the scene, you don’t need to pan or tilt
* When tracking or static don't turn the camera to the action (See direction) 

# Close up and far away

* Things that are close will look distorted because of the lens
* Things that are far away will be indistinguishable as the resolution of the screens is not good enough
* Stay within a 3 - 5 feet  of the camera, you'll want to keep the camera closer to the action than you think

# Direction

The viewer is the camera and they are part of your scene. Ask yourself what their role is and direct the scene accordingly.

* Use sound to direct people to the action
* Use narration or presenters to point or direct the viewers to the action
* Use CGI or visual cues to direct viewers to the action
* Use people coming closer to the camera to gain attention
* This all needs to be done in one shot
* You need to give the viewer enough time for people to realize where the action is 
* You need to give the viewer enought time to move and digest what you are directing them too

## Tricks

* Shooting direct to camera and acknowledging the viewer down the lens creates a high level of immersion

# Shot positions

The point of having a 360 degree view of scene is that you feel more immersed when wearing a headset but also in most cases that there are things to look at in various directions.

* In the center of action with it coreographed around the camera
* A fly on the wall in documentary style with potentially slow tracking maintaing the orientation of the camera at all times
* The viewer is the camera and they are part of your scene, if you intend them to 'be' there as another human hold the camera at chest level
* Stabilize the camera especially if intending to view on a headset
* Honor the horizon line, especiially if intending to view on a headset

# Lighting

* Lighting will be in the shot
* Embrace ambient light
* Theres two cameras each dealing with exposure, flat lighting is good as each lens gets a consitent exposure
* This is a point and shot sub £200 camera it will artifact in darkness and won't handle things like a Arctic white out
* Avoid positioning your talent directly under any overhead lights

# Audio

* The microphone is the viewers ears, place it at roughly the same height as the camera and along the same vertical and horizontal axis
* The microphone will be in shot so the above is not easy, you may want to record a wild track seperately when there is no speech in scene
* Insure the microphone is on the spatial audio setting
* Insure the microphone is open in 360 degrees
